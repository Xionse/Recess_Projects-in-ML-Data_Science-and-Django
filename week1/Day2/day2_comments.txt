# Exception Handling in Python:
"""

# In Python, exception handling is a mechanism to handle errors or exceptional situations that may occur during program execution.
# It allows you to catch and handle specific exceptions gracefully, preventing the program from crashing.

# The basic structure of exception handling in Python involves the following keywords:

# try:
#     The code block placed inside the 'try' block is the one where an exception might occur.
#     It is the section of code where you anticipate potential errors.

# except ExceptionType:
#     If an exception of type 'ExceptionType' occurs inside the 'try' block, the corresponding 'except' block is executed.
#     'ExceptionType' represents the specific type of exception that you want to handle.
#     You can catch and handle specific exceptions, such as ValueError, TypeError, or FileNotFoundError, or use a more general 'except' block to handle any exception.

# except ExceptionType as error:
#     You can assign the exception instance to a variable 'error' using the 'as' keyword.
#     This allows you to access the details of the exception and handle it accordingly.

# else:
#     The 'else' block is optional and executed if no exceptions occur in the 'try' block.
#     It contains code that should run only if the 'try' block does not raise any exceptions.

# finally:
#     The 'finally' block is optional and always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
#     It is useful for performing cleanup tasks or releasing resources that should be done regardless of the outcome of the exception handling.


try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / x
    print("Result:", result)

except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Handling a specific exception (division by zero)
    print("Cannot divide by zero")

except ValueError as error:
    # Handling a specific exception (invalid input)
    print("Invalid input:", str(error))

except Exception as error:
    # Handling any other exception
    print("An error occurred:", str(error))

else:
    # Code executed if no exceptions occur
    print("No exceptions occurred")

finally:
    # Code always executed
    print("Finally block")
